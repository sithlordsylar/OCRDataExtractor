# Simple OCR Contact Extractor

A lightweight, browser-based OCR tool built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS using [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js). This tool allows SMEs and non-technical users to quickly extract contact details from image files (e.g., screenshots of business cards or WhatsApp messages) and export the data as CSV or XML files. It includes a session mode for bulk processing and an intuitive, color-coded interface.

## Features

- **Session Mode:** Process multiple images in one session and export combined results.
- **Data Selection:** Easily label scanned text lines (Name, Contact Number, Email) via dropdowns.
- **Export Options:** Export the extracted data as CSV or XML.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes modals, tooltips, and alternating line colors for improved readability.
- **Customization:** Replace the placeholder logo with your own business logo.

## Customization

### Changing the Result Display Colors

By default, the tool uses the following color scheme for displaying OCR results:

- **Odd-numbered lines:**  
  - **Background Color:** White (`#ffffff`)
  - **Text Color:** Black (`#000000`)

- **Even-numbered lines:**  
  - **Background Color:** Light blue (`#00b5de`)
  - **Text Color:** White (`#ffffff`)

To change these colors to match your brand, open the `styles.css` file and locate for the comment "Line item styling with alternating colors" which has the following CSS rules:

```css
.line:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
}
.line:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #00b5de;
  color: #fff;
}
```
Simply replace the hex color codes (#fff, #000, #00b5de, etc.) with your desired colors. Save your changes and refresh your deployed site to see the new color scheme in action.

### Troubleshooting

- **No Response on Button Clicks:**  
  Ensure your browserâ€™s JavaScript console (F12) shows no errors. Check that all file names and IDs in your HTML match those in the JavaScript code.
  
- **OCR Accuracy Issues:**  
  Try using clearer images. You might also experiment with Tesseract.js settings or consider preprocessing images for better results.
